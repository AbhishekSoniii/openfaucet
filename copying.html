<div class="line">stating that You changed the files; and</div>

<div class="line">the Derivative Works; and</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">(d) If the Work includes a &#8220;NOTICE&#8221; text file as part of its</div>

<div class="line">or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided</div>
<div class="line">that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed</div>
<div class="line">as modifying the License.</div>
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and</div>

<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,</div>
<div class="line-block">

<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<div class="line">7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or</div>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line">agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each</div>
